## About <a name="about"></a>

Flix is a full stack Ruby on Rails app to rate, review, and discover movies. It's really just a 'sandbox' app for me to try out some Ruby and Rails code.

## Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>

- Ruby 3.2.2
- Rails 7.0.4
- Sqlite3 (for development)
- PSQL (for deployment)
- AWS (for storing movie images)
- Capistrano (for deploying to my server)

## Description  <a name="Description"></a>

A hosted version of this app can be found at https://morning-brook-10617.herokuapp.com/. Flix is responsive with a mobile first approach.<br>

1. Simply browse a list of movies, OR <br>
2. Sign up with an email, and a password to login to read, review, fave, and rate a movie. (Admins only can create a new movie listing at this time).<br>
3. The home page loads all the movies in the database.<br>
3. Select a movie to read a synopsis of the movie and optionally (must be signed in) write a review.<br>
4. Manage your profile info, including linking your externally hosted gravatar. <br>
